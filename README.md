# Phantom FX

A multi-user forex trading platform built with Next.js, TypeScript and Prisma.

Every client gets a **demo account** (virtual $10,000) and a **live account** (funded through admin-approved deposits).

## Features

- **Trading terminal**: live FX prices for 10 major pairs (Yahoo Finance, with a simulated fallback), candlestick charts (1m–1d), market/limit/stop orders, stop loss / take profit, leverage from 1:10 to 1:500, margin, free margin, equity and margin level
- **Risk engine**: fills pending orders, triggers SL/TP, auto stop-out at a 50% margin level (worst position closed first), negative balance protection
- **Wallet**: deposit and withdrawal requests (M-Pesa, bank transfer, card, USDT) with a full transaction ledger
- **History**: closed trades, order history, ledger, win rate
- **Admin panel**: approve/reject deposits and withdrawals, manage clients (suspend, adjust balance), monitor open positions and house exposure, force-close positions, edit spreads/commission/lot limits, audit log

## Quick start

Requirements: Node.js 20+.

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env      # then set AUTH_SECRET and ADMIN_PASSWORD
npm run setup             # creates the SQLite DB, seeds instruments + admin user
npm run dev               # http://localhost:3000
```

Sign in as the admin with `ADMIN_EMAIL` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` from `.env`, or register a new client at `/register`.

## Scripts

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Dev server |
| `npm run build` / `npm start` | Production build / server |
| `npm test` | Unit tests (trading math) |
| `npm run lint` / `npm run typecheck` | ESLint / TypeScript |
| `npm run setup` | `prisma db push` + seed |

## Configuration

See `.env.example`. Key settings:

- `PRICE_FEED`: `yahoo` (live, falls back to simulated if unreachable) or `simulated`
- `ENFORCE_MARKET_HOURS`: reject orders while the FX market is closed (Sun 22:00 – Fri 22:00 UTC)
- `DEMO_BALANCE`: starting balance for demo accounts

## Production notes

This is a working trading platform, but it is **not ready to take real client money yet**:

- **Execution**: the platform is the counterparty for all trades (B-book). Hedging to a liquidity provider (e.g. via FIX/bridge) is not implemented.
- **Payments**: deposits/withdrawals are manual requests that an admin approves. No payment gateway (M-Pesa Daraja, Stripe, etc.) is connected yet.
- **Compliance**: you need a forex broker license (e.g. CMA in Kenya), KYC/AML checks and segregated client funds before you can accept real deposits.
- **Infrastructure**: use Postgres (change the `provider` in `prisma/schema.prisma`) and run a **single** app instance. The price feed, trading engine and account locks run in memory, inside one process.
- **Market data**: Yahoo Finance is unofficial and rate-limited. Use a licensed feed for production.
- **Accounts**: there is no email verification, password reset or 2FA yet.
